At The first meeting, we has been presented a kit called iTCLab, this kit is one of practical tool to start learning about IoT or Internet of Things, like how IoT system works, IoT programming, and start practically develop control system based on IoT, all that related to this kit is shared generously in [Mr. Basuki github's.](https://github.com/bsrahmat)\
iTCLab is started when he saw a potential further research and development from a kit called TCLab, a product that invented by BYU (Brigham Young University) in Provo, Utah, United States of America. We are also motivated from this lecture to do a further research with the new information technology trends that can be started from doing journal reading from [science direct.](https://sciencedirect.com)

## Research Development based on iTCLab

The next meeting, we going more further to know about IoT for research and publication especially with iTCLab kit as an example. This meeting agenda is get to know further about Internet of Things(IoT), how to do a research and publication with it, know the detail about iTCLab and do practically program the IoT.

> Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging area in which billions of smart objects are interconnected with each other using Internet for data and resource sharing. (Chahal, Kumar and Batra, 2020)

IoT Architecture classified to four layer (Ravidas et al., 2019)

1. Application Layer
2. Middleware Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Physical Layer

Basic of IoT System

1. Hardware (Things) - example : kit iTCLab
2. Application, example : IoT MQTT Panel
3. Cloud Data Center & Internet, example : IoT Stadium PT Wowrack

Some Examples from IoT Application

- Smart Home
- Smart Farming
- Internet Industry
- Health
- Transportation

Further Information about iTCLab

- Motivation of iTCLab is creating global pocket control system miniature product that can be IoT practical learning package, such as introducing IoT, IoT Programming, and develop IoT based control system that insipred by TCLab Kit from BYU.
- TCLab has three main component : Sensor, Actuator and Controller. The component difference between TCLab and iTCLab is TCLab using Arduino Uno and iTCLab using ESP32 as the microcontroller.
- The iTCLab advantages is TCLab Plus, this kit can connected as IoT.
- iTCLab is a suitable kit for learning IoT, dynamics system, control system, machine learning, Arduino and Python programming.
- [Research and Publication example of iTCLab](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/itclab-temperature-monitoring-and-control-system-based-on-pid-and-internet-of-things-iot/319461)

## Machine Learning on IoT

For the last meeting, we learn about machine learning application on IoT. Machine learning can be defined as artificial intelligence application that can do various task based on data it learn. Advantages of Machine Learning is to optimize hardware resource and grant convenience for user that need to handle human behavior computation of certain tasks. In this meeting we also learn about XOR Application using Machine Learning and Tuning PID - Machine Learning Application on IoT.
